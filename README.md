The workflow includes:

* Data ingestion & preprocessing
* Feature creation (BMI categories, hormonal averages)
* KPI development using DAX
* Dimensional data modeling
* Interactive Power BI dashboard design

### Power BI Dashboard Focus:

* Hormonal health trends
* Lifestyle impact on PCOS
* Demographic distribution
* Reproductive biomarkers

The project showcases:

* Healthcare data analytics
* Women’s health domain understanding
* KPI-driven dashboard design
* DAX-based measures
* Business Intelligence storytelling
